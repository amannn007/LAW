Functionality:

1. In each firm for each lawyer select a day and see all the available slots for that day and book an appointment (and can delete only the future appointments from his history)
2. Every lawyer has fixed slots for a day after all the slots are booked it shows “Appointment not
   available for this day”
3. Complete appointment history

Included description for each appointment so that it'll be easy to add new fields (like documents realted to the appointments etc..)in future

As the redux store is already setup its easy to scale for adding and deleting new firms and lawyers similar to adding and deleting appointments

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
